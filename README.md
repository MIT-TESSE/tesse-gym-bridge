# gym-ros-interface

An interface between [tesse-gym](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/tesse-gym) and ROS. 
This package takes requests from [tesse-interface](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/tesse-interface) (used by tesse-gym) and responds with data from rostopics, 
allowing for inputs from sources such as [Kimera](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS).
