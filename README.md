## Installation

1. Clone and build this repo

```sh
# setup catkin workspace
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin init

# clone repo
cd src
git clone git@github.mit.edu:TESS/gym-ros-interface.git

# install dependencies
wstool init
wstool merge gym-ros-interface/install/tesse_gym_bridge.rosinstall 
cd ..

# compile
catkin build

# source workspace
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

#### To run an RL Agent with Kimera-VIO and Kimera-Semantics, the following steps are required

2. Install [Kimera-VIO-ROS](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS) and [Kimera-Semantics](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-Semantics)

Please refer to their installation guide.


3. Install [tesse-interface](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/tesse-interface/tree/feature/rgb-metadata) and switch to branch `feature/rgb-metadata`

Follow the tesse-interface [installation instructions](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/tesse-interface) then:

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/tesse-interface
git checkout feature/rgb-metadata 
```

4. Install [tesse-gym](https://github.mit.edu/TESS/tesse-gym)
This isn't a ROS package, so you don't have to install it into your `catkin_ws`

```sh
cd ~/your_directory
git clone git@github.mit.edu:TESS/tesse-gym.git
cd tesse-gym
python setup.py develop
```


## Usage

To run TESSE, Kimera-VIO, and Kimera-Semantics, and the required interfaces

```sh
roslaunch tesse_gym_bridge run_kimera_tesse.launch tesse_path:=TESSE_BUILD_PATH
```

To control the TESSE agent through the Gym environment, run see the [move-agent](./notebooks/move-agent.ipynb) notebook
