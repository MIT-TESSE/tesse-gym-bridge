cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin init

# clone repo
cd src
git clone https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-gym-bridge.git

# install dependencies
wstool init

cd ..

# compile
catkin build

# source workspace
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

#### To run an RL Agent with Kimera-VIO and Kimera-Semantics, the following steps are required

2. Install [Kimera-VIO-ROS](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS) and [Kimera-Semantics](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-Semantics)

Please refer to their installation guide.

3. Install [tesse-interface](https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-interface) 

4. Install [tesse-ros-bridge](https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-ros-bridge)

5. Install [tesse-segmentation-ros](https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-segmentation-ros)



## Usage

To run TESSE, Kimera-VIO, and Kimera-Semantics, and the required interfaces start the simulator and then run:

```sh
roslaunch tesse_gym_bridge run_goseek_perception.launch
```

To control the TESSE agent through the Gym environment, see the [move-agent](./notebooks/move-agent.ipynb) notebook. This requires installing [tesse-gym](https://github.com/MIT-TESSE/tesse-gym) in a Python 3.7 environment.
